# Architector

Architector is a 3D chemical structure generation software package designed to take minimal 2D information about ligands and metal centers and generates chemically sensible 3D conformers and stereochemistry of the organometallic compounds.
It is capable of high-throughput in-silico construction of s-, p-, d-, and f-block organometallic complexes. Architector represents a transformative step towards cross-periodic table computational design of metal complex chemistry.

## Installation

Conda installation recommended. The conda-forge distribution can be installed via: 

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge architector
```

* In case a developer version of the sofware is required in the root directory for Architector run:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate architector
pip install -e .
```

## Useful Tools/Examples:

1. See tutorials for basic introduction to capabilties and code examples: `documentation/tutorials/`
2. Reference for core and ligand geometry labels see: `documentation/view_default_core_ligand_types.ipynb`
3. Utility for aiding in determining ligand coordination sites see: `utils/ligand_viewing_coordinating_atom_selecting.ipynb`
4. Reference for debugging cases where no structures are generated see: `documentation/Debugging_Guide.ipynb`

* Note that ligands used in (3) can even be drawn in [Avogadro](https://avogadro.cc/) and or most other 2D molecular editors (e.g. ChemDraw) and copied as SMILES strings into this analysis.
* If other analyses are used to determine the coordinating atom indices we can't guarantee the generated structure will match what was input. If generating complexes with new ligands we HIGHLY recommend using the utility in (3)

## Basic Use of complex construction functionality:

```python
from architector import build_complex
out = build_complex(inputDict)
```

## Input dictionary structure and recommendations:
```python
inputDict = {
################ Core (metal) structure and optional definitions #####################
# Requires input for what metal and what type of coordination environments to sample #

"core": {
    "metal":'Fe', 
    # "coordList" OR "coreType" OR "coreCN" (Suggested!)
    'coordList': None, 
    # Handles user-defined list of core coordination vectors e.g.
    # [
    #     [2., 0.0, 0.0],
    #     [0.0, 2., 0.0],
    #     [0.0, 0.0, 2.],
    #     [-2., 0.0, 0.0],
    #     [0.0, -2., 0.0],
    #     [0.0, 0.0, -2.] 
    # ] -> gets defined as 'user_geometry'
    "coreType": None, 
    # e.g. 'octahedral' ....
    # or list of coreTypes - e.g. ['octahedral','trigonal_prismatic','tetrahedral']
    "coreCN": 6 #(SUGGETED!)
    # Core coordination number (CN) (int)
    # Will calculate all possible geometries with the given coreCN 
    # Tends to sample the metal space better than other options.
    # OR list of CNs [4,6] -> Will calculate all possible geometries with these CNs.
    # NOTE that if nothing is passed, a list of common coreCNs will be used to attempt structure generation.
    }, 
############## Ligands  list and optional definitions ####################
# Requires either smiles and metal-coordinating site definitions or default ligand names  #

"ligands": [
    {"smiles":"n1ccccc1-c2ccccn2",
    # Smiles required. Can also be generated and drawn using avogadro molecular editor.
    "coordList":[0, 11], 
    # Coordination sites corresponding to the SMILES atom connecting to the metal
    # Can be determined/assigned manually using utils/ligand_viewing_coordinating_atom_selecting.ipynb
    # Alternatively [[0,1],[11,2]], In this case it forces it to be map to the user-defined core coordinating sites.
    'ligType':'bi_cis'
    # Optional, but desirable - if not-specified will will assign the best ligType guess using a brute force assignment that can be slow. 
    }, 
    ],
    # NOTE - multiple ligands should be added to fill out structure if desired.

############## Additional Parameters for the structural generation  ####################
# Here, metal oxdiation state and spin state, methods for evaluating complexes during construction, #
# And many other options are defined, but are often handled automatically by Architector in the background #

"parameters" = {
    ######## Electronic parameters #########
    "metal_ox": None, # Oxidation State
    "metal_spin": None, # Spin State

    "assemble_method": "GFN2-xTB", # Which method to use for assembling conformers. 
    # For very large speedup - use "GFN-FF", though this is much less stable (especially for Lanthanides)
    # Additionaly, it is possible to use "UFF" - which is extremely fast. Though it is recommend to perform an XTB-level optimization
    # for the "full_method", or turn "relaxation" off.
    "xtb_solvent": 'none', # Add any named XTB solvent!
    "xtb_accuracy": 1.0, # Numerical Accuracy for XTB calculations

    # FF preoptimization helps especially in cases where longer carbon chains are present that tend to overlap.

    "seed": None, # If a seed is passed (int/float) use it to initialize np.random.seed for reproducability.
    # If you want to replicate whole workflows - set np.random.seed() at the beginning of your workflow.
    # Right not openbabel will still introduce randomness into generations - so it is often valuable
    # To run multiple searches if something is failing.

    # Dump all possible intermediate xtb calculations to separate ASE database
    "dump_ase_atoms": False, # or True
    "ase_atoms_db_name": 'architector_ase_db_{uid}.json', # Possible to name the databse filename

    # or integer index in reference to the ligand list!!
    "force_trans_oxos":False, # Force trans configurations for oxos (Useful for actinyls)
    "lig_assignment":'bruteforce', # or "similarity" - How to automatically assign ligand types.

    ######### Sanity check parameters ########
    "assemble_sanity_checks":True, # Turn on/off assembly sanity checks.
    "assemble_graph_sanity_cutoff":1.8, 
    # Graph Sanity cutoff for imposed molecular graph represents the maximum elongation of bonds

}
```

## Output dictionary structure and recommendations:
```python
out = {
    'core_geometry_i_nunpairedes_X_charge_Y': 
    # Key labels indicates metal center geometry, total unpaired electrons (X, spin), 
    # and charge (Y) of the complex
    {'ase_atoms':ase.atoms.Atoms, # Structure (with attached used ASE calculator!) for the output complex.
    'total_charge': int, # Suggested total charge if another method used.
    'calc_n_unpaired_electrons': int, # Suggested unpaired electrons if another method used.
    'xtb_total_charge':int, # Same as (Y) (different from total_charge for non-oxidation state=3 f-block elements!)
    'xtb_n_unpaired_electrons' : int, # Same as (X) Unpaired electrons used for xTB (different for f-block elements!) 
    'metal_ox': int, # Metal oxidation state assigned to the complex
    'init_energy': float, # Initial (unrelaxed) xTB energy (eV)
    'energy': float, # Relaxed xTB energy (eV)
    'mol2string': str, # Final relaxed structure in TRIPOS mol2 format.
    'init_mol2string': str, # Initial unrelaxed structure in TRIPOS mol2 format.
    'energy_sorted_index': int, # Index of the complex from pseudo-energy ranking,
    'inputDict': dict, # Full input dictionary copy (including assigned parameters) for replication!
    ..... Timing information ....},
    ** More structures **
}
```

* Note that output dictionary is an OrderDict sorted by energy (first entry is the lowest in energy.)

Within the jupyter notebook framework it is quite easy to visualize all of the generated structures directly from the dictionary:
```python
from architector import view_structures

view_structures(out)
```

With the following example line it is quite easy to export to xyz for use in any other electronic structure code:
```python
out['core_geometry_i_nunpairedes_X_charge_Y']['ase_atoms'].write('core_geometry_i_nunpairedes_X_charge_Y.xyz')
```

Alternatively, a file format converter is included with Architector which can read the formatted mol2 filetypes,
which can be quite useful for maintaining the defined molecular graph and bond orders:

```python
from architector import convert_io_molecule

mol = convert_io_molecule(out['core_geometry_i_nunpairedes_X_charge_Y']['mol2string'])
print(mol.uhf) # n_unpaired electrons for electronic structure evaluation
print(mol.charge) # total charge
mol.write_xyz('core_geometry_i_nunpairedes_X_charge_Y.xyz')
```

Included in the Architector Molecule python object (mol, above) is also the molecular graph (mol.graph) and SYBYL type bond orders (mol.BO_dict),
xTB unpaired electrons (mol.xtb_uhf), and a full ASE Atoms object (mol.ase_atoms) with the assigned charge (mol.charge) and magnetic moments (mol.uhf)
from the output mol2string.
